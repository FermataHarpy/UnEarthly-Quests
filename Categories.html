                         <h1> Card Quests 21.0	</h1>
                         <p><em>Disclaimer: These quests are specifically created for adults ages 21 and up.  This is because they involve alcoholic beverages, though they can be adapted those for under the age of 21.</em> </p>
                         <h2> Board Quest Categories </h2>
                         <p>No board required but it is not for the weak or faint at heart.  Based off the well known drinking game Categories, also known as Kings. <a href="https://www.drinkiwiki.com/Kings">(original rules here)</a> Catgories is played in several ways, but we tend to play it by just drawing cards and doing the specified action based on that card going around the table from person to person.  This version got tiresome after the 100th time playing it so we switched it up, now it's bigger, better, and drunkier.</p>
                     	<ul>
                        	<li><strong>Adventures Needed</strong>: 3+</</li>
                            <li> <strong>Equipment Needed</strong>: 1-2 decks of cards (2 if you want to get REALLY messed up), a six sided dice, tokens, and drinks.  Tokens can be anything, you'll need one for each player.  We've used coins, screws, anything small we could find around the house.  Or you could use pieces from other board games</li>
                         	<li><strong>Drunken Status at end of game:</strong>
                            	<ul>
                               		<li>Drinking Beer or Wine with 2 decks: 7</li>
                               		<li> Drinking Beer or Wine with 1 deck: 5 </li>
                               		<li> Drinking Liquor/Mixed Drinks with 2 decks: 9-10</li>
                                	<li> Drinking Liquor/Mixed Drinks with 1 deck: 7-8 </li>
                                </ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Be the first to land on the last card </li>
                       	</ul>
                        <h3><strong>Game Play</strong></h3>
                         <ol>
                         	<li> 1. Shuffle the deck </li>
                         	<li>2. Have each player roll the dice, highest roller goes first </li>
                         	<li>3. The first person to play rolls the dice, you lay out that many cards in a row and they place their token on that card </li>
                            <li>4. Do the action of the card they land on (actions below </li>
                            <li>5. The person to their right plays, laying cards down in a row for each number they roll over the last player.  For example, if the first person rolled a 4, and the next rolls a 6 you would place down 2 more cards and the player puts their token down on the 6th card.  If the second player rolled a 2, they would placed their token on the second card from the beginning. </li>
                            <li> The game continues in this manner </li>
                         </ol>                  
                         <h3><strong>Actions</strong> </h3>
                         <ol>
                         	<li><strong>Ace: Waterfall</strong>
                            	<ul>
                                	<li>Each person starts drinking, when the player who rolled the dice stops drinking, the next person can stop, when they stop drinking the next person stops, and so on until the last person.  This is the least favorite card of any body but assholes because you can make the people after you drink for as long as you want them to as long as you also continue drinking. </li>
                                </ul></li>
                             <li><strong>2: Two for You </strong>
                             	<ul><li>The person who rolled gets to allocate 2 drinks to any player they want.  This can also be split up between 2 players if desired. </li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>3: Three for Me</strong> 
                            	<ul><li>The person who rolled takes 3 drinks </li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>4: Four for Whores</strong>   
                                <ul><li>All women at the table drink</li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>5: Never Have I Ever</strong>
                            <ul><li>Each player puts up 3 fingers.  Starting with the player who rolled you.  This player says "Never have I ever..." and states something they have never done.  Anyone who has done that puts a finger down.  For example: Never Have I Ever Gone Mountina Climbing.  Anyone who has gone mountain climbing would but a finger down.  This continues onto the next player and the first person to put all 3 fingers down takes a drink, the action is over and play continues.  Remember the play continues in the same order of rolling, not from the last person to put their finger down.</li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>6: Six for Dicks</strong> 
                            <ul><li>All men at the table take a drink </li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>7: Sentence</strong>
                            <ul><li>Starting with the person who rolled, they say one word to start a sentence, the next person says the word the previous word plus another word.  This continues around the table until someone messes up the sentence.  For example: Player 1: The.  Player 2: The Dog.  Player 3: The Dog Barks.  Player 4: The Dog Barks Loudly.  Player 5: The Dog Loudly Barks.  Player 5 would then have to take a drink because they messed up the sentence.  Then the action is over and play continues. </li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>8: Date</strong>
                                <ul><li>The perosn who rolled picks a 'date'.  Now those 2 are dating, and whenever one of them drinks the other has to as well.  This also means if a man is dating a woman, the man has to drink on 4's and the woman also has to drink on 6's and so on.  This rule is canceled when another player lands on another 8. </li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>9: Nine Nine Busta a Rhyme</strong>
                            <ul><li> The person who rolled chooses a word for everyone else to rhyme with.  It has to be a rhymable word, nothing like Orange or Silver.  Then going in order each person at the table has to come up with a word that rhymes with the original word.  The first person who takes too long to come up with a word or can't takes a drink, the action is over and play continues</li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>10: Categories</strong>
                            <ul><li>Similar to Bust a Rhyme, the roller choose a catgory.  Each person around the table, going in order of play, comes up with something within that category.  The first person who takes too long or can't come up with something takes a drink, the action is over and play continues.  For example: The category is Marvel Super Heroes.  Player 1: Spider Man, Player 2: Iron Man, Player 3: Bat Man.  Player 3 would drink because Batman isn't a Marvel Superhero, he's DC and player 3 should know that but they're too drunk and only heard super heroes. </li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>Jack: Jack Back</strong>
                                <ul><li> This card has 2 parts.  First: The previous roller has to take a drink.  Second: The current roller goes back to the previous card in the row and does that action. </li></ul> </li>
                            <li><strong>Queen: The Pee Card</strong>
                                <ul><li><strong>NOBODY CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM UNTIL THIS CARD IS PLAYED.</strong>  Once the card is landed on anybody at the table can use the bathroom.  <em>Of course don't be stupid and if someone has to throw up let them, and if someone has a medical problem let them use the bathroom.  Shouldn't have to say this, but people are dumb :)</em> </li></ul> </li><strong></strong>
                            <li><strong>King: The King Rules</strong>
                            <ul><li>This rule can override any other rule, or you can make up your own rule. The rule is canceled the next time a King is landed on. Examples of rules: 
                            	<ul>
                                	<li><strong>1. The Thumb Rule:</strong>  When the player who created the rule places their thumb on the table everyone else places their thumb on the table and the last person to lay down their thumb drinks.</li> 
                                    <li><strong>2. Little Green Man:</strong> Each time someone takes a drink they have the "Take the little green man off their drink, then drink, then remember to put him back on.  If they forget they drink.

                                    <li><strong>3. Any body can pee whenever they want</strong> </li>
                                    <li> <strong>4. Whatever the heck you want your rule to be</strong> </li>                                    </ul>
                            </li></ul>  </li>
                            <li> <strong>Joker</strong>
                                <ul><li>If the joker is layed down, but not landed on the person who rolled finishes half their drink.  If the joker is landed on they finish their entire drink </li></ul> </li>
                            </li>
                         </ol>
<h3> Ending the game </h3>
	<p> The game ends when the last card is landed on.<br />
    <em>Optional:</em> The game ends when someone LANDS on the last card in the deck, if they don't land on it exactly they go back 6 and play continues until someone lands on the last card exactly </p>
    
    <p> There you have it.  The best way to play categories (or Kings) </p>
